                <h2>About Chess</h2>
                <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape capture.</p>
                <p>The game of chess has a rich history dating back over a thousand years. It originated in India and spread to Persia before becoming popular in Europe during the Middle Ages. Over the centuries, chess has evolved into a competitive sport and a powerful tool for developing strategic thinking, concentration, and problem-solving skills.</p>

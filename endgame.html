                <h2>Endgame</h2>
                <p>Chess endgame technique refers to the strategic principles and methods employed in the final phase of a chess game, typically when few pieces remain on the board. The focus shifts from opening principles and middlegame tactics to achieving specific goals such as promoting a pawn to a queen, creating mating nets, or utilizing the king's activity. Endgame techniques include concepts like king activity, pawn promotion strategies, and key squares, along with understanding theoretical positions like opposition and zugzwang. Mastery of endgame technique is crucial as it often determines the outcome of close games, requiring precise calculation and strategic finesse to convert advantages into victory or defend against determined opponents</p>
